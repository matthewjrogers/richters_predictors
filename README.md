# richters_predictor
This repo contains the data exploration and modeling work I have done for the DrivenData Richter's Predictor competition. 

The goal of this competition is to predict the level of damage to buildings in Nepal from the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. My current best score (micro-averaged F1) is .7457 (top 5% of competitors)
